Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects memory,
thinking, and behavior. It happens due to the abnormal buildup of proteins in and around brain
cells, leading to brain damage over time. The exact cause is not fully understood,
but the disease is associated with several key processes:

#### High-Risk Factors for Alzheimer’s Disease
=> The following factors have been strongly linked to a higher risk of developing Alzheimer’s:

1. Family History & Genetics 🧬 (Non-modifiable)
Having a first-degree relative (parent or sibling) with Alzheimer's increases the risk.
The APOE-e4 gene is the strongest genetic risk factor.
2. Diabetes (Type 2) 🩸 (Modifiable)
High blood sugar damages blood vessels in the brain and promotes inflammation, increasing Alzheimer’s risk.
Insulin resistance can also lead to amyloid plaque buildup.
3. Hypertension (High Blood Pressure) 💓 (Modifiable)
High blood pressure can reduce blood flow to the brain, increasing the risk of brain damage and cognitive decline.
4. High Cholesterol Levels 🛢️ (Modifiable)
Elevated LDL ("bad") cholesterol is linked to amyloid plaque formation in the brain.
Low HDL ("good") cholesterol may also contribute to Alzheimer’s risk.
5. Sleep Problems (Chronic Poor Sleep) 💤 (Modifiable)
Poor sleep, especially insomnia and sleep apnea, prevents the brain from clearing beta-amyloid proteins.
Long-term sleep deprivation significantly increases dementia risk.
6. Depression 😞 (Modifiable)
Long-term depression is associated with brain inflammation and reduced brain volume in memory-related areas.
Chronic stress and anxiety may also increase dementia risk.
7. Air Pollution Exposure 🌫️ (Modifiable)
Long-term exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) leads to brain inflammation and oxidative stress, accelerating cognitive decline.
Moderate to High-Risk Factors
Obesity (High BMI) ⚖️ – Midlife obesity increases inflammation and vascular damage.
Smoking 🚬 – Increases oxidative stress and damages brain cells.
Heavy Alcohol Consumption 🍷 – Excess alcohol accelerates brain shrinkage.
Low Physical Activity 🏃‍♂️ – Sedentary behavior increases Alzheimer’s risk.
